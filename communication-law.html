            <h2>Howâ€™s it Going?</h2>
            <p>This is a difficult class, but so far it's been fairly smooth-sailing. The first few weeks of lecture have been mainly review for me. Comm Law is not the most exciting class, however, and I suspect that later in the semester I will find it easy to tune out of the lecture by accident. Despite all of this, the content is fairly interesting, and I look forward to seeing how the course progresses.</p>
