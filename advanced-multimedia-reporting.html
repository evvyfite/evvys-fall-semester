            <h2>Howâ€™s it Going?</h2>
            <p>Even thought reporting is not my planned career path, Advanced Multimedia Reporting is a fantastic class so far. It is giving me great practice with videography that I can apply to anything else I want to. Jared is one of my favorite professors, and was a big part of my decision to switch from Communication to Multimedia Journalism, so he understands my motivations behind taking the class. It's also a great wayto get familiar with several different kinds of cameras, as my earlier Journalism classes have introduced me to DSLRs and now I'm working with fancy newsroom cameras.</p>
