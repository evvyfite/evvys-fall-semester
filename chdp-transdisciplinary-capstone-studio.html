            <h2>Howâ€™s it Going?</h2>
            <p>For the past year and a half, I've been working with Hypnos, an interdisciplinary student team with the goal of developing optimal sleep habitation for the future of space travel. I love working with this team, and am very excited to see what this semester brings. My role on the team is Marketing & Image Lead, and this year my big plan is to create a documentary about the team, which I can't wait to get started on. The time of this class is less than optimal, but everything else about it is a wonderful opportunity.</p>
