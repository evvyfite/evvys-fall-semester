            <h2>Howâ€™s it Going?</h2>
            <p>Having a movement class in the morning before a full day of other classes is even more fantastic than I had hoped. This class gives me the opportunity to open up and distance myself from my problems before a busy day, and it also seems like a good way to expand my comfort zone. The mix of movement with scientific lecture caught me by surprise, but the content is very interesting, and she does a great job of including the right balance of each activity. I think this class will be even more wonderful as the rest of my classes get more difficult later in the semester.</p>
